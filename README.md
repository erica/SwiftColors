**Goal**: To extend existing Color types (UIColor, NSColor, SKColor, etc) rather than introduce a ground-up color model with supporting types.

**Note**: The dictionaries with color literals are not very happy right now in Xcode,  so you may be better off using the hex versions

**Thanks**: Kevin Ballard, Greg Titus, Gwynne Raskind, Arnaud Coomans, and everyone else who helped out and pitched in.
